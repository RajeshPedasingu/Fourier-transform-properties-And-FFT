# Fourier-transform-properties-And-FFT
1)in this we will Verify the All properties of Fourier transform using function of MATLAB fft.
2)Generate the rectangular pulse signal of appropriate size. Use MATLAB function fft to find the Fourier transform.
3)Generate a sinusoidal signal of length 0.5 seconds with frequency 100Hz, sampled at 8000Hz. Plot the magnitude and phase spectrum of the Fourier transform.
4)Generate a Gaussian function with zero mean and variance 1. Plot the magnitude spectrum of the Fourier transform of the signal.
5)Generate a dual tone signal by adding two sinusoidal signals of length 0.5 seconds and different frequencies. Normalize the frequency axes to find out the frequencies present in the given signal.
6)Find the frequency content of the given audio signals.
